# REXX-Library

This repository contains a collection of useful REXX code snippets to accomplish common
programming tasks. The routines are intended to be incorporated into a CMS MACLIB and then
inserted into your execs via the supplied INLINE XEDIT macro.

Routines are included using a single linen REXX comment(s) of the form:

/* $$INCLUDE maclib-membername description */
  
Improvements and additions are welcome if you have a better way to do any of these tasks.
Enjoy!
